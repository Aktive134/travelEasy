## Application Detail
This application orchestrates a travel booking platform with Nest.js, employing a microservices architecture. It encompasses three core microservices: user management, flight bookings, and hotel reservations, each handling distinct functionalities. Communication between microservices utilizes a message broker like RabbitMQ or Kafka for seamless interaction. Moreover, OAuth 2.0 authentication and authorization mechanisms are integrated to ensure secure user authentication and resource access across the system, enhancing data integrity and user privacy.
